Interactive storyboarding tool


## Getting Started

### Step 1: Prerequisites

You'll need:

* [Java 1.8 or later] (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/)
* [Chrome browser] (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* [PlantUML Jar 1.2019.13 or later] (http://plantuml.com/)
* [Graphviz (dependency of PlantUML)] (https://plantuml.com/starting)

### Step 2: Download storydoc

1. Download master ZIP file from the storydoc [master.zip] (https://github.com/story-doc/js/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip it.

We assumed that the required Jar files (storydoc.jar and plantuml.jar) are located in a same folder:

    js-master/
    ├── doc/
    ├── samples/
    ├── plantuml.jar
    ├── README.md
    ├── storydoc.jar
    └── storydoc.js

### Step 3: Storyboard sample story

1. Go to samples/SearchStoryboard folder and open index.html with your browser.
2. You will be able to storyboard Product Search User Story as same experience as the sample [SearchStoryboard] (https://story-doc.github.io/SearchStoryboard/index.html)

### Step 4: Generate storydoc HTML

1. Go back to js-master folder.
2. Run the command below from a command line:

```
$ java -jar storydoc.jar samples/SearchStoryboard/index.html
```

storydoc.html will be generated in the samples/SearchStoryboard folder.
It will be same as this [storydoc.html] (https://story-doc.github.io/SearchStoryboard/storydoc.html)
